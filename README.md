## Project Overview

Using Kaggle's dataset, I created an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze the impact of lifestyle factors on sleep. Through integrating data (patient demographic table and sleep study observation table) and visualizing key indicators for comprehensive insights.




## Key Questions: 

1) Does people’s stressful occupation affect their sleep quality
2) Do factors like physical activity and stress impact the quality of sleep?
3) Which age group sleep gets more affected?
4) At what age is there a common occurrence of sleep disorder?
5) Is there a gender disparity in sleep quality?



## Steps Taken

1) Pulled the data from Kaggle, joined the two tables, identified the key indicators, cleaned them, and prepared them for analysis.
2) Utilizied pivot tables to aggregate KPIs at the top of the dashboard page
3) Creating Charts and placing them in the dashboard tab
4) Creating a slicer for age range & gender and then syncing all the tables together for filtering
5) Formatting all sections of the dashboard and creating an overall theme




## Key Findings

1) Stressful occupations (e.g., Sales Representatives, Scientists) correlate with poorer sleep quality, whereas less stressful jobs (e.g., Accountants, Engineers) promote better sleep. As seen on the top dashboard ☝🏻
2) Regular physical activity (>1 hour) and low-stress levels (less than 4/10) contribute to improved sleep quality☝🏻
3) Young adults (20-30) in stressful occupations with limited physical activity face poor sleep quality 👇🏻

4) Sleep Disorder Prevalence: Insomnia peaks among 40-50-year-olds in stressful professions (e.g., Nurses, Salespersons).

5) Female experience poorer sleep quality due to higher stress, less physical activity, and increased sleep disorders like Sleep Apnea.
